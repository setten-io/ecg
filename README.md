`ecg` is a cosmos validator [Dead Man's Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch).

---

As long as the monitor is receiving heartbeats from ecg, alerting will not be triggered.
This "failure as default" approach makes this kind of monitoring resilient to failures that might otherwise prevent you from receiving any alert.

Examples:

- Your whole infra loses connectivity
- Monitoring services is down at the same time as the validator
- Monitoring service can't access the validator
- Monitoring service lose access to its data source (ie: LCD)

> **Warning**
>
> Monitoring is essential.
> Ecg and heartbeat style monitoring are complementary to other monitoring tools and methods.
> We recommend ecg as an aditional failsafe alongside more proactive tools.

There are multiple SaaS platforms like [Better Uptime](https://betteruptime.com) or [Dead Man's Snitch](https://deadmanssnitch.com) that implement heatbeat monitoring.

## Features

`ecg` will:

1. For each target, fetch a state from all clients
2. Keep the freshest one (highest block height)
3. Run checks on it 
4. If they all pass, send heartbeat

Checks include:

- block height increased
- validator block misses didn't increase
- validator isn't jailed
- validator isn't tombstoned

## Getting Started

This tool is installable as a crate.

```bash
cargo install ecg
```

Or available as a Docker image.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/setten-io/ecg
```

## Usage

```md
ecg
Heartbeats for cosmos validators

USAGE:
    ecg [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help           Print help information
    -p, --path <PATH>    Path to yaml config [env: ECG_CONFIG_PATH=] [default: ecg.yaml]
    -V, --version        Print version information
```

It is possible to change ecg logging level through the `ECG_LOG` env var, or for all/any module through the `RUST_LOG` env var.

## Configuration

`ecg` is configured through a yaml file.

The default path is `./ecg.yaml` but can be specified through the `-p/--path` flag or the `ECG_CONFIG_PATH` env var.

### Specification

<details>
<summary><code>targets.&lt;name&gt;</code></summary>
<br>

The name of your target;
Should be self-explanatory.

</details>


<details>
<summary><code>targets.&lt;name&gt;.url</code></summary>
<br>

The url of the monitor to send `GET` http heartbeat requests to.

</details>


<details>

```

</details>


<details>
<summary><code>targets.&lt;name&gt;.interval</code></summary>
<br>

> Optional, default to 30
